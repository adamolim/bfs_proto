quarto_titlepages relies on features of Quarto that are new. To help us out, 

* Please run `quarto --version` from a terminal (shell) and report the Quarto version you are using. 
* Tell us what operating system you are on.

Does the bug relate to PDF output? 

* How you are rendering Quarto docs (RStudio, VS Code, command line, etc)?
* What TeX and version you are using? Run `tex --version` in a terminal (or shell).
